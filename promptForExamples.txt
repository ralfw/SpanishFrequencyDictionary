Given a comma-separated list of words, transform each word into a Spanish example sentence in the present tense, in which the word is used. Output the result as a list of lines, where each line contains the 0-based index of the word followed by the Spanish example sentence, and also an English translation of the example. Use a $ character to separate the Spanisch sentence and the translation. Be sure to invent a Spanish example for each and every word in the list separately!

Here is an example:

List of words: raton,comer,sobre

Transformed list:
0:El raton bebe leche.$The mouse drinks milk.
1:Yo como arroz.$I each rice.
2:Leo un libro sobre gatos.$I am reading a book about cats.

Each entry consists of the 0-based index followed by a colon and the Spanish sentence and a $ and finally the English sentence.

Now do the same with this list of words: {WORDS}
