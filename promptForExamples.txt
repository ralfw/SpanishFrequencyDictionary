Transform the words in the following list:

{WORDS}

Transform each word by finding a simple Spanish example sentence using the word. Use verbs only in the present tense! 
And also translate the Spanish sentence into English.

Deliver the transformation as a list with each entry on its own line.
Each entry consists of three columns: the word from the list (small letters), the Spanish example sentence, and the English translation.
Use $ as a column separator.
