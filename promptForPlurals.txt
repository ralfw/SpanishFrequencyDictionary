Given a comma-separated list of words, transform each word into its grammactical plural and output the result as a list of lines, where each line contains the 0-based index of the word followed by its grammatical plural. 

Here is an example:

List of words: gato,raton,casa

Transformed list:
0:gatos
1:ratones
2:casas

Each entry consists of the 0-based index followed by a colon and the grammatical plural.

Now do the same with this list of words: {WORDS}
