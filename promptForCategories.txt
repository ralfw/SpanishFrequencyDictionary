Given a comma-separated list of words, transform each word into its grammactical category and output the result as a list of lines, where each line contains the 0-based index of the word followed by its grammatical category. 

Here is an example:

List of words: gato,beber,sobre

Transformed list:
0:noun
1:verb
2:preposition

Each entry consists of the 0-based index followed by a colon and the grammatical category.

Now do the same with this list of words: {WORDS}
