Given a comma-separated list of words, transform each word into its grammactical gender and output the result as a list of lines, where each line contains the 0-based index of the word followed by its grammatical gender. 

Here is an example:

List of words: gato,ciudad,casa

Transformed list:
0:masculine
1:feminine
2:masculine

Each entry consists of the 0-based index followed by a colon and the grammatical gender.

Now do the same with this list of words: {WORDS}
