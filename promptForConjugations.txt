Given a comma-separated list of words, transform each word into its grammactical conjugated forms in the present tense and output the result as a list of lines, where each line contains the 0-based index of the word followed by its grammatical conjugated forms for all grammatical persons. 

Here is an example:

List of words: beber,comer,ir

Transformed list:
0:bebo,bebes,bebe,bebemos,bebeis,beben
1:como,comes,come,comemos,comeis,comen
2:voy,vas,va,vamos,vais,van

Each entry consists of the 0-based index followed by a colon and the grammatical plural.

Now do the same with this list of words: {WORDS}
